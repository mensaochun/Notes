# Some details

Here is a straight-forward recipe to understand the Expectation Maximisation algorithm:

1- Read this EM tutorial paper by Do and Batzoglou. [paper](http://ai.stanford.edu/~chuongdo/papers/em_tutorial.pdf)

2- You may have question marks in your head, have a look at the explanations on this maths stack exchange page. [question]( https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/25111/how-does-expectation-maximization-work)

3- Look at this code that I wrote in Python that explains the example in the EM tutorial paper of item 1:

Warning : The code may be messy/suboptimal, since I am not a Python developer. But it does the job.
